####Question  
What is a "dangling else"? How are else clauses resolved in C++?  
####Answer  
The dangling else is a problem in computer programming in which an optional else clause in an if–then(–else) statement results in nested conditionals being ambiguous.  

This problem is resolved in c++, by associating the else with the nearest if.
