A null statment is a statement that has no real effect on the programÂ´s logic. A null statement can be implemented by writing a single semicolon.  
```cpp
; // Null statement.
```
Null statements are sometimes needed te fulfill language requirements. A common example is a loop where all the work is done within the condition of the loop. A null statement is then needed to prevent the statement after the loop from being run in each iteration of the loop.
