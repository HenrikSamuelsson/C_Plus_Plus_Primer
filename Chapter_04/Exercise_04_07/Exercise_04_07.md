An exprission for deciding if a number is even or odd can be written in the following way.  
```cppp
some_number % 2 == 0
```
This expression will evaluate to true whenever some_number is even, since the remainder when dividing an even numeber by 2 is always zero. In a similar fashion so will the expression always evaluate to false when some_number is odd, because the remainder will always be 1 in these cases.
