####Question
What are the values of i and d after each assginment?  
(a) `d = i = 3.5;`  
(b) `i = d = 3.5;`  
####Answer  
(a) 3.5 will be converted to int by truncation to 3 and then assigned to i, the value of i will then be converted to double and assigned to d, i.e. i will be 3 and d will be 3, or at least some floating point number very close to 3.  
(b) d will be assigned 3.5, or att least something very close to this value, the value of d will then be convereted to int by truncation to 3 and assigned to i.
