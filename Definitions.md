Definitions
===========
A
-  
**abstract data type** Model for a certain class of data structures that have similar behavior. An abstract data type is defined only by the operations that may be performed on it.  
**address** Refers to a memory location.  
**alias declaration** Setups another name for a type by the aid of the using keyword.  
**argument** Value passed to a function in the code. Can also be a value passed from the command line to the main function.  
**arithmetic types** A type that is built into the c++ language itself. Some common examples are bool, char, int, and double.   
**assignment** Set or re-set the value stored in the storage location denoted by a variable name.  
B
-
**bit** The basic unit of information in computing. A bit can have only one of two values, commonly represented as 0 and 1.  
**block** Statements gated by curly braces.  
**buffer** Region used to store data temporarily. Note that streams are often buffered and this may lead to unexpected behavour in some situtations.  
**built-in type** Type defined by the language itself, common examples are bool, char, int, double.  
C
-
**capture list** Part of a lambda expression that specifies if and how one or more variables can be used by the lambda.  
**cerr** Standard output stream for errors. Will often have the same destination as cout.  
**character string literal** Term sometimes used as synonym for string literal.  
**cin** Object of class type istream, used for reading data, in form of characters, from the standard input.  
**class** Fundamental feature used for creation of user defined types.  
**class type** Defined using class specifiers. The definiton starts with the class, struct or union keyword, other parts are the class name and class member declarations.  
**clog** Standard output stream for logging. Can for example report events in the program execution to a log file.  
**comment** Code that is ignored by the compiler. Written for the developers by the developers to document and clarify the code.  
**condition** Expression that will be evaluted during program execution to either true or false.  
**constexpr** Specifier used to declare that it is possible to evaluate the value of the function or variable at compile time.  
**cout** Object of class type ostream, used for writing data to an output.  
**curly brace** Symbol that comes i two different shapes, the open curly ({), and the close curly (}). Used to indicate where a block starts and ends in the code.  
D  
-  
**data structure** Data elements grouped together under one name.  
**decltype** A keyword used to query the type of an expression. Comes in handy in generic programming where it can be difficult to deduct the type of an expression.  
E  
- 
**edit-compile-debug** Summary descripton on the steps used in the software implementation process.  
**ellipsis** Special notation formed by writing three dots (...). Used to indicate that a function takes an unspecified number of parameters.  
**encapsulation** An object oriented programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.  
**end-of-file** Special marker indicating that there is no more data left to read in a file, exact representation depends on choice of underlying system.
**EOF** Abbreviaton for end-of-file.  
F  
-  
**for statement** Provides a mechanism that allows code to be executed repeatedly.  
**forward declaration** Declartion of an identifier that have not yet been given a complete definition.  
**functor** Class that acts like a function by overloading the function call operator.  
G
-
**generic algorithms** Type-indepent, finite step by step procedure.  
**global scope** The outermost scope, used to define global variables or other global constructs, that shall be valid and visible to the compiler at all times.  
H  
-  
**header** Section at the top of file with include directives. A convinient way to make it possible to use definitons from other files.  
I  
-  
**if statement** Mechanism that makes it possible to choose if a certain block of code shall be run or not, depending on a run time condition.  
**in-class initializer** Initalization of a class data member when it is declared.  
**incomplete type** Type that at a given time have been declared but lacks a definiton.   
**inline function** A function qualified with the keyword inline. Suggests to the compiler that it should substitute the function call with the body of the function inline. This saves on the overhead caused by function calls but requires more memory to store the code.  
L  
-  
**lambda expression** A lambda is a programming technique that is related to anonymous functions. A lambda implicitly defines a function object class and constructs a function object of that class type.  
**library type** Type defined by the C++ Standard Library.  
M
-
**manipulator** Functions specifically designed to be used in conjunction with the insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators on stream objects. One example of such a function is std::endl.  
N  
-  
**null pointer** A pointer that currently do not point at anything.  
O  
-  
**object** This term has different meanings depending on the context. Will often refer to an instance of a class but can also be used more losely when refering to a variable or just a value of some type in a contingious region of the memory.  
**ostream** A type in the std library that can be used to write characters sequences or representations of other kinds of data.  
P  
-  
**parameter** A variable whitin a function declaration. Indicates what type and how many variables the function takes as arguments when called.  
**pointer** An object that holds an address or 0.  
S  
-  
**separate compilation** Support for separation of the source files into different modules that can be compiled one by one and then pieced together into an executable program. This feature simplifies the development phase.  
**scope operator**  The scope operator helps to identify and specify the context to which an identifier refers. In C++ the scope operator is written "::".  
T  
-  
**template** Feature that supports generic types in functions and classes. Allows a function or class to work on many different data types without being rewritten for each one.  
**trailing return type** Function declaration syntax that ends with an arrow (->) and then finally the return type. Added to the language to support some special template cases but can also be used for more mundane function declarations.   
U
-
**unsigned** A keyword that is used as type specifier for integer types. Indicates that the type only holds values greater than or equal to zero.  
W
-
**word** The natural unit of data used by a particular processor design. The word size is the preferred size for moving units of information around. The size of a word is often mesarued in bits.
Sym
---
**() operator** Call operator. Executes a function.
