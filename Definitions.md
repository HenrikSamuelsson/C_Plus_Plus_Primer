Definitions
===========
A
-
**argument** Value passed to a function in the code. Can also be a value passed from the command line to the main function.  
**arithmetic types** A type that is built into the c++ language itself. Some common examples are bool, char, int, and double.   
**assignment** Set or re-set the value stored in the storage location denoted by a variable name.  
B
-
**bit** The basic unit of information in computing. A bit can have only one of two values, commonly represented as 0 and 1.  **block** Statements gated by curly braces.  
**buffer** Region used to store data temporarily. Note that streams are often buffered and this may lead to unexpected behavour in some situtations.  
**built-in type** Type defined by the language itself, common examples are bool, char, int, double.  
C
-
**cerr** Standard output stream for errors. Will often have the same destination as cout.  
**character string literal** Term sometimes used as synonym for string literal.  
**clog** Standard output stream for logging. Can for example report events in the program execution to a log file.  
**curly brace** Symbol that comes i two different shapes, the open curly ({), and the close curly (}). Used to indicate where a block starts and ends in the code.  
D  
-  
**decltype** A keyword used to query the type of an expression. Comes in handy in generic programming where it can be difficult to deduct the type of an expression.  
E  
-  
**end-of-file** Special marker indicating that there is no more data left to read in a file, exact representation depends on choice of underlying system.  
**EOF** Abbreviaton for end-of-file.  
F  
-  
**for statement** Provides a mechanismn that allows code to be executed repeatedly.  
G
-
**global scope** The outermost scope, used to define global variables or other global constructs, that shall be valid and visible to the compiler at all times.  
H  
-  
**header** Section at the top of file with include directives. A convinient way to make it possible to use definitons from other files.  
M
-
**manipulator** Functions specifically designed to be used in conjunction with the insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators on stream objects. One example of such a function is std::endl.
U
-
**unsigned** A keyword that is used as type specifier for integer types. Indicates that the type only holds values greater than or equal to zero.  
W
-
**word** The natural unit of data used by a particular processor design. The word size is the preferred size for moving units of information around. The size of a word is often mesarued in bits.
