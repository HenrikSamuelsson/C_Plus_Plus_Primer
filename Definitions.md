A
-
**argument** Value passed to a function in the code. Can also be a value passed from the command line to the main function.  
**arithmetic types** A type that is built into the c++ language itself. Some common examples are bool, char, int, and double.   
**assignment** Set or re-set the value stored in the storage location denoted by a variable name.  
B
-
**bit** The basic unit of information in computing. A bit can have only one of two values, commonly represented as 0 and 1.  
C
-
**cerr** Standard output stream for errors. Will often have the same destination as cout.  
**clog** Standard output stream for logging. Can for example report events in the program execution to a log file.  
G
-
**global scope** The outermost scope, used to define global variables or other global constructs, that shall be valid and visible to the compiler at all times.  
M
-
**manipulator** Functions specifically designed to be used in conjunction with the insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators on stream objects. One example of such a function is std::endl.
U
-
**unsigned** A keyword that is used as type specifier for integer types. Indicates that the type only holds values greater than or equal to zero.  
W
-
**word** Term for the natural unit of data used by a particular processor design. The word size is the preferred size for moving units of information around. The size of a word is often mesarued in bits.
