####Question  
Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?  
(a)  
```cpp
int double = 3.14;  
```
(b)  
```cpp
int _;  
```
(c)  
```cpp
int catch-22;  
```
(d)  
```cpp
int 1_or_2 = 1;
```
(e)  
```cpp
double Double = 3.14;  
```
####Answer  
(a) Invalid because double is a keyword and can hence not be used to name a variable.  

(b) Valid but not a good choice for a variable name. Names starting with a underscore are usually reserved for libraries, compiler, and operating system specific code. Also this name does not describe what the variable is supposed to be used for.
 
 
(c) Invalid a dash (-) is not allowed to be used in variable names.  

(d) Invalid a variable name can not start with a number.  

(e) Valid but not a very good name since names starting with a uppercase letter usually indicates class types and not one of the built in types.
