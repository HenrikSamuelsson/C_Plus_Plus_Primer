Determine the type and the difference among the following groups of literals. 

**'a', L'a', "a", L"a"**
All of the above literals reprsents the letter a but in differents forms.

'a' &nbsp;&nbsp; Character literal included in the most basic source character set on the system.  

L'a' &nbsp;&nbsp; A wide character literal, type is wchar_t, this type can on some systems represent a greater number of characters than the basic set. 

"a" &nbsp;&nbsp; A string in the most basic source character set. An extra null character will be included at the end of a string literal. 

L"a" &nbsp;&nbsp; An a stored as a string in the form of a wide character literal.  

**10, 10u, 10L, 10ul, 012, 0xC**
The five first of the above literals represents the decimal number 10 but in different forms. The last literal is 12 in decimal.

10 &nbsp;&nbsp; Signed int representation.

10u &nbsp;&nbsp; Unsigned int representation.

10L &nbsp;&nbsp; Signed long representation.

10ul &nbsp;&nbsp; Unsigned long representation.

012 &nbsp;&nbsp; Signed int representation, written in octal form.

0xC &nbsp;&nbsp; Signed int representation, written in hexadecimal form.
