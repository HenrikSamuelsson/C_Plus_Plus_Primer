####Question  
What are the defferences between int, long, long long, and short?  
####Answer  
All of these types are used for storing integers. The difference between the types lies in how much memory they use to store the integers. More memory means that larger values can be stored. A short will for example use at least 16 bits of memory but an long will use at least 32 bits.  
####Question  
What are the differences between an unsigned and a signed type?  
####Answer  
Only positive numbers can be handled by an unsgined type. Signed types can be used to store both negative and positive numbers.  
####Question  
What are the differences between a float and a double?  
####Answer  
Both of these types can be used to store floating points numbers. The difference is that a double is often able to handle larger numbers and also keep track of more significant figures. This is because an double often gets more memory when storing variables, compared to a float. Exact numbers of bits used for the storage of floating point numbers is system dependant but using 32 bits for float and 64 for double is commom.
