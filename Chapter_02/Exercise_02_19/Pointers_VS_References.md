The key differences between pointers and references are:  
* A pointer can be re-assigned, a reference cannot.
* A reference must be assigned at initilization, a pointer can be assigned later on.
* A pointer have an address in memory, a reference share the same memory address as the orginal variable.
* A pointer need to use the deference operator * to access the value that the pointer points to, a reference can be used directlyp
