Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into a single component. Classes can be used for encapsulation in C++. It is possible to hide members of a class from the "outer world" by making them private. A private member cannot be changed directly but can possibly be changed by special access functions built into the class. This is a good feature since it makes it possible to prevent corruption by for example illegal states. This can be done by having the function responsible for changes run control checks before changing the state.
