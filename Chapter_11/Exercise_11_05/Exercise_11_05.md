####Question
Explain the difference between a map and a set. When might you use one or the other?  
####Answer
Conceptually, a set is a collection of values, whereas a map is collecton of keys that are linked to values. This means that a map is more complex than a set.  

A set is used to group variables with common properties. Say for example that we are building a search engine and want to ignore common words such as, the, be, to,	of,	and, a, in, etcetera. These words can then be put in a set and then be ignored by the search algorithmn.  

Maps can be used to link related information together. An int that holds a social security number can for example be mapped to a string that hold the name of the person.
