####Question  
Describe the differences between a map and a vector.  
####Answer  
A vector stores the data in an internal array that it resizes and you add more elements. An unordered_map uses a hash table internally.  
A key is used to store and retrieve an element in a map. Elements in a vector are stored based on the position in the container.
