Three different variations have now tried that all achieve the same functionality. A for each loop was used in exercise 3.6 and this exercise used a for loop and a while loop.  

My personal opinion is that the while loop is a bit clumsy in this case. Using a for loop or a for each loop are both valid solutions, mostly a matter of taste in my opinon.
