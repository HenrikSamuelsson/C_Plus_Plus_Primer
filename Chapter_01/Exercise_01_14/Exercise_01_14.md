For loops and while loops are very similar so it is probably mostly a question about programming style which one shall be used in a given situtation.  

For loops are often used when all the loop control logic is collected together in the header of the loop. There should not be any altering of the control variables in the body of the loop in this case.

It feels more natural to use a while loop in the cases when the conditon is based around a boolean variable.
