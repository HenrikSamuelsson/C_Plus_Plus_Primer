####Question
How does the protected access specifier differ from privat?
####Answer
Private members are accessible within the class, and by friends of the class.  

Protected members are, like private members, accessible within the class and by friends of the class. But protected members are also accessible by derived classes and by friends of the derived class.  

It can be seen from the above that private is a more restricted access level than proteceted.
