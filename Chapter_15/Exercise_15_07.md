####Question
Define static type and dynamic type.  
####Answer
**static type** Type of a variable, or result of an expression, that can be deduced just by reading the source code. This means that the static type is known at compile time and the compiler can hence check for incorrect static type usage.  
**dynamic type** Exact type of an object is not deduced until run time. Makes it possible to chose between different types of objects at rum time as long as the type is of certain class or a subclass of this class.
